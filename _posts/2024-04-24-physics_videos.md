# Cool demo of videos on Markdown with a ELEC4630-appropriate Physics spin

I think I've discovered in hunting for tricks to format these blog posts a cool way to embed videos into markdown. So I'll try that and try to throw a few cool physics/maths videos in at the same time (seems appropriate given the quantum spin of our last question). 

## The IBM Video itself
Of course, the first one, courtesy of Brian (I found it quite interesting).

## Some Semiconductor Physics
Just an interesting video on semiconductors I came across the other day

## Stand-up Maths + Minecraft = ‚ù§
Floating point precision meets triangular numbers!
